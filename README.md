# Using Bayesian Networks to Predict the Success of Wheat Yields in the Free State

Soil quality and drought resistance are among the predominant characteristics that affect the success of a yield in the South African wheat industry. 
These characteristics themselves are dependant on other random variables that can be observed or unobserved.
There are 18 nutrients essential for proper crop development. 
The absence of any one of these nutrients has the potential to decrease crop yield by negatively affecting the crop’s growth. 
Soil is a major source of these nutrients to crops. Therefore, soil quality has a direct and profound affect on the crop yield.

Soil moisture is one of the main factors influencing soil nutrients. Therefore, soil quality is dependent on soil moisture. Soil moisture is the water stored in the soil and is affected by precipitation and temperature. Therefore, in our Bayesian network soil moisture is dependent on precipitation and temperature. 
Common knowledge suggests that temperature is dependent on precipitation and sunlight.
In the South African context, a crop’s ability to survive in drought-like conditions has a direct impact on crop yield. 
The mineral potassium (K) reduces the deleterious effects of drought stress on plants by the most significant factor, hence drought resistance is heavily dependent on potassium levels in the soil. 
Cold shock proteins (CSPs) enhance acclimatisation of bacteria to severe environmental circumstances, such as droughts. The Escherichia coil CSP genes CspA and CspB have been modified to plant-preferred codon sequences and named SeCspA and SeCspB. 
Scientific investigations have shown SeCspA transgenic wheat lines pos- sess significant and stable improvements in drought tolerance when compared to control plants not containing the gene.
Because SeCspA’s confer drought tolerance, drought resistance is dependent on the crops being genetically modified to include this protein.
This model assumes independence between the crops’ resistance to drought and soil quality. 
Factors external to this model that could impact the outcomes include natural disasters and pests.
